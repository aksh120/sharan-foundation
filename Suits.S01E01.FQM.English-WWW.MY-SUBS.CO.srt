2
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:49,950
Gerald Tate's here.

3
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:51,350
He wants to know
what's happening to his deal.

4
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:52,880
Go get Harvey.

5
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:04,860
I check.

6
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:06,100
Raise.

7
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,300
5,000.

8
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:10,370
I'm all-in.

9
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:19,910
You can pay me later.
I got to go.

10
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:22,580
Gentlemen.

11
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,250
I'm paying you millions,

12
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,920
and you're telling me
I'm gonna get screwed?

13
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:30,650
Jessica, have I come
at a bad time?

14
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,920
Gerald, this is Harvey Specter.

15
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:37,130
He's our best closer.

16
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,630
Well, if you're
the best closer,

17
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,300
where the hell you been
for the last three hours?

18
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:42,500
Well, Gerald, I specialize
in troubled situations,

19
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:43,700
and when I left here
at 7:00 P.M.,

20
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,600
this deal wasn't in jeopardy,

21
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:47,170
so I'm just trying to figure out
what happened in the interim.

22
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,540
We keep offering more money.

23
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:50,040
They keep rejecting it.

24
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,780
It's last-minute
bad faith bullsh--.

25
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,810
Says here that Cooper
won't be staying on

26
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,980
as honorary vice president.

27
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:57,880
That's right.
I don't want him around.

28
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:58,950
He wouldn't be around.

29
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:00,250
It's an honorary position.

30
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,450
I don't give a sh--.

31
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,320
Well, I think you do,

32
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:05,160
because that's what's changed
since I left,

33
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:07,590
which means it's you
who's been dealing in bad faith.

34
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:09,790
Well, now that you've got
a grasp on what's happened

35
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:11,360
in the goddamn interim,

36
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:13,100
what are you gonna do about it?

37
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,760
Because he's not getting
that title.

38
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:18,140
Well, let me make sure
I understand this, okay?

39
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,740
We negotiated a deal that
gave you everything you wanted,

40
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:23,540
Mr. Cooper signed it,
and now you won't close

41
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:25,410
until we take away
the last shred of his dignity?

42
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,740
We negotiated a deal that
gave you everything you wanted,

43
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:23,540
Mr. Cooper signed it,
and now you won't close

44
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:32,220
and my firm doesn't operate
in bad faith.

45
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:35,120
Oh.
I see how it is.

46
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:36,360
Instead of working Cooper,

47
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:38,620
you're working me.

48
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:41,030
Well, why don't you take
your pansy attitude

49
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:43,630
back in there
and make him sign my deal?

50
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,360
Or I'll pay someone else
your money

51
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:47,900
to do it for me.
First of all, Gerald,

52
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:49,740
if you think
anyone's gonna touch this deal

53
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,670
after your bad faith,
you're mistaken.

54
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:56,110
Second, the way
our agreement works is,

55
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:57,740
the minute Cooper
signed the deal

56
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:59,310
which gave you everything
you wanted,

57
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:02,350
our fee was due and payable,
which is why at 7:30

58
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:05,420
I received confirmation
of a wire transfer

59
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:08,520
from escrow indicating payment
in full.

60
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,400
So I'd say
the ball's in your court,

61
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:19,000
but the truth is
your balls are in my fist.

62
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:22,470
Now I apologize if that image
is too pansy for you,

63
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:23,900
but I'm comfortable enough
with my manhood

64
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:25,240
to put it out there.

65
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:26,870
Now get your ass in there

66
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,980
and close the goddamn deal.

67
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,740
You gonna let him talk to me
like this?

68
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:34,150
Harvey speaks for the firm.

69
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:50,760
We got paid
before Gerald signed the deal?

70
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:52,200
What are you talking about?
This is a memo

71
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:53,870
about some fire drill
on Tuesday.

72
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:55,530
- Huh.
- You're the Blue Team Captain.

73
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,440
You get to wear a fire hat.

74
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:13,520
Time's up.

75
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:15,950
Pencils down.

76
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:18,790
Excuse me.
Do I know you from somewhere?

77
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:20,720
I don't think so.

78
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:23,700
I have a pretty good memory
for faces.

79
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:26,860
So do I.

80
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:30,430
- Sorry.
- I got it.

81
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:44,610
Hey.
Hey!

82
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,120
Stop! You in the cap!

83
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,120
What did you get me?

84
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:22,720
What I said
I was gonna get you.

85
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:25,790
A 158.
I told you I wanted a 175.

86
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,090
And I told you
only 1 out of 100 people

87
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,030
can score that.

88
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:32,030
You're a B-minus student.
You got 1,000 on your sats.

89
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,660
If I get you a 175,
they'll know you cheated.

90
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:36,570
So only a genius loser
can get a 175?

91
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:39,100
Actually, no.
I would get a 180.

92
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:41,540
Now can I have my money,
please?

93
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:49,950
Whoa.
This is only half.

94
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:51,450
Then why don't you
go call the police?

95
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:58,960
I got to get my sh--
together.

96
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:00,960
That's the best cheeseburger
I've had in my life.

97
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:04,500
It's from Monday, Trevor.

98
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,800
Look, man, I'm serious.

99
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:07,400
I almost got caught today.

100
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:08,870
I've got
to stop getting stoned.

101
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:10,170
I've got to get
my act together.

102
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,700
Dude, look at me.

103
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:14,210
You can burn bud
and still be a success.

104
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:15,880
You sell pot for a living.

105
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:17,840
Still saps the motivation.

106
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:20,550
All I'm saying is, you want in,

107
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:22,010
you are in.

108
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,020
You know, that is word for word

109
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,920
your offer before I got caught

110
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:28,050
cheating on your math test
in the third grade.

111
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,120
Goddamn memory.

112
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:30,890
Stop.

113
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,090
Look, no one's gonna suspect
you're a dealer.

114
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,090
I mean, look at me.

115
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,960
This is a $2,000 suit, Mike.

116
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:37,430
I got, like, 12 of 'em.

117
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,200
I take on
real software projects.

118
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:43,900
I have clients who bring me
briefcases filled with cash,

119
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:45,470
and I hand them
identical briefcases

120
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:46,940
with vacuum-sealed bud.

121
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:48,740
So what do you need me for?

122
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:51,010
Well, I have a client
coming in from out of town,

123
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,650
and I can't meet him,

124
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:55,620
and I need someone I can trust
to make the drop.

125
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,220
It's totally safe.

126
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,950
Trevor, a person
is more likely to die

127
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:00,390
while dealing drugs
than they would be

128
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:02,650
on death row in Texas.

129
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,120
Wait.
What are you talking about?

130
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,460
It's from <i>Freakonomics.</i>

131
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:06,620
Do you read anything
that I give you?

132
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:08,490
It doesn't matter,

133
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,130
because you have to find
somebody else.

134
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,360
I'm not interested.

135
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:13,530
Not interested in what?

136
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,770
What are you doing here?
You said you were gonna stay

137
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:15,770
at your place tonight.

138
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:17,530
Hi, sweetie.

139
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,000
What a pleasant surprise.

140
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:20,910
I'm so glad you stopped by.
Yeah.

141
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:22,140
We're in the middle
of something.

142
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:24,180
What are you in the middle of?

143
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,040
Trevor's trying to set me up.

144
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:27,410
That's terrific.

145
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,250
Who's the lucky girl?

146
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,120
I'm trying to get him
to work for me.

147
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:32,990
That's a great idea.

148
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:34,520
It will take some stress
off Trevor,

149
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:35,590
and you'll pick up writing code

150
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:37,560
like you do everything else.

151
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:39,060
All right.
I got to go.

152
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:40,790
I got go get up early
to see my grandmother

153
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:41,900
and pay them another month.

154
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,460
Oh.

155
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:46,370
- Good night.
- Bye.

156
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:51,940
How did you know Gerald
wouldn't look at that memo?

157
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,010
Because a charging bull
always looks at the red cape,

158
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:55,540
not at the man with the sword.

159
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:57,680
By the way,
I've set up a meeting

160
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:59,880
for you and John Dockery
next week.

161
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:01,380
Dockery?
He's Skadden's biggest client.

162
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:02,450
Not anymore.

163
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:04,280
He's looking around.

164
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:05,620
He plays tennis.
I want you to close him.

165
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:07,050
Consider it done.

166
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,090
Then you are
officially dismissed

167
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,960
for the evening.

168
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:13,630
Cheers.

169
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:14,690
Well, you two seem
to be celebrating something.

170
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,030
Mm-hmm.
We are.

171
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,600
In fact, you are looking

172
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:19,900
at the best closer
this city has ever seen.

173
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:21,200
Closer, huh?

174
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:22,600
Baseball?
Attorney.

175
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:24,100
I close situations.

176
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,010
Hmm.
So you only care about money?

177
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:27,840
The truth is,
I do it for the children.

178
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:31,350
I'm Lisa.

179
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:32,650
Harvey.

180
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,720
Lisa, I don't normally do this,

181
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:37,390
but since we are celebrating,

182
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:39,290
what time do you get off
tonight?

183
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,290
I'm glad you asked.

184
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,600
I get off at ten past
"I'm never going out with you."

185
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:52,270
I guess you're not the best
closer this city's ever seen.

186
00:08:55,610 --> 00:09:03,380
♪ ♪

187
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:07,720
Good morning.

188
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:09,350
Lisa, this was lovely,

189
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:11,120
but I'm afraid you have to go.

190
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:12,860
- Aw.
- I hate to miss a workout,

191
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,160
and I really need
to be in the office by 7:30.

192
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:17,430
Can't we have breakfast?

193
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,930
You could eat it
off my stomach.

194
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,200
I guess if I skip the gym,

195
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:22,170
I can still get in by 9:00.

196
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:36,650
I hear someone's
not taking their pills.

197
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:39,320
Because they're trying
to poison me.

198
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:41,520
Grammy, that's crazy.

199
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:42,990
Dr. shrager gave me her word

200
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:45,490
she wouldn't poison you
until January.

201
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:47,090
If she does it before then,
she can't count it

202
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,290
towards next year's quota.

203
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:54,460
Oh, what did I teach you?

204
00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:01,170
Michael, I'm not gonna be
around forever.

205
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:06,610
And I want you to stop
with that stuff.

206
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:07,910
What stuff?

207
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:10,480
I may be old,

208
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:12,410
but I'm not an idiot.

209
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,620
I know life has been hard
for you,

210
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,120
but you're not a kid anymore,

211
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:17,890
and I want you to promise

212
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:20,290
you're gonna start living up
to your potential.

213
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:27,560
I promise.

214
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:32,840
I'm not saying that I haven't
been charmed by Harvey,

215
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,670
but it's just so patronizing

216
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:36,410
when you say
that he can handle those things

217
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:37,940
and, "Louis,
you can only handle this."

218
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:39,840
Jessica, I could have handled
Gerald Tate.

219
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:41,180
And I told you I disagree.

220
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,080
- Why?
- Because when you put

221
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:44,410
two bullies
in the same room together,

222
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,410
things generally
don't go so well.

223
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,880
It's 9:30.
Nice of you to show up

224
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:49,750
two hours after we open
for business.

225
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:51,790
And I see that you're also
trying to look like a pimp.

226
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:54,650
My bad, Louis.
I was out late last night.

227
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,590
And when I woke up,
this is the suit

228
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:56,920
your wife picked out for me.

229
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,560
And that would be funny

230
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:00,360
if I'd actually been married.
Moving along.

231
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:02,530
- You're not married?
- Recruiting. Harvey.

232
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,230
Your interviews are set up
for tomorrow.

233
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,730
What?
Why don't we just hire

234
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,600
the Harvard summer associate
douche?

235
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:09,770
I think if you listen
to the phrasing

236
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,770
of that question,
you'll come up with an answer.

237
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,580
We need people who think
on their feet,

238
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,140
not another clone
with a rod up his ass.

239
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:17,110
Harvey, the fact
that we only hire from Harvard

240
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:19,050
gives us a cache
that's a little more valuable

241
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,650
than hiring a kid from Rutgers.

242
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:24,420
You went to Harvard law.

243
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:26,320
I'm an exception.

244
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:27,920
Find me another one.

245
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:29,760
Can we please skip
the recruiting?

246
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:31,460
I work better alone anyway.

247
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:33,060
Well, I would, Harvey,

248
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:35,100
except all senior partners
get an associate.

249
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,970
It's just a rule.

250
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:39,630
I'm sorry.
What?

251
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:40,900
Jessica, I deserve
that promotion.

252
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:42,670
My billables destroy his.

253
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:45,140
And I'm here night and day
doing whatever's needed

254
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:46,740
instead of swanning
in and out of here

255
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:48,480
whenever I please.

256
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,950
I must admit, he does make me
sound very swan-like.

257
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:52,050
Harvey,

258
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,920
shut up.

259
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,850
Louis, this is how it is.

260
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:00,190
All right,
now you two make nice.

261
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:02,690
Louis, I apologize.
I was out of line.

262
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:06,460
Now if you'll just let me text
your pretend wife

263
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:09,730
that I just made senior partner,
I--what?

264
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,730
Your grandmother's
getting worse.

265
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,670
I need to move her to full care

266
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:15,700
or I'll have to transfer her
to the state facility.

267
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:17,670
I won't put her
in a state facility.

268
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:20,170
Then I'm afraid you'll have
to come up with $25,000.

269
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:24,580
Trevor, I'm in.

270
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:26,980
One-time deal.
I want 25.

271
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:28,050
Take it or leave it.

272
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,280
I'll take it.

273
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:30,420
There's a briefcase in my room.

274
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:31,590
Pick it up tomorrow,

275
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:33,290
take it to room 2412

276
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,750
at the Chilton Hotel.

277
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,390
Now you can't go
to a luxury hotel

278
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:38,260
looking like a delivery guy,
so shave,

279
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:40,160
comb your hair, buy a suit.

280
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:41,890
That's a hell
of a lot to ask, man.

281
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,330
Well, I'm not asking you.
I'm paying you $25,000.

282
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,360
Okay?

283
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:48,230
Yeah, he's in.

284
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,600
Good.

285
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:51,770
I'm gonna go take a piss.

286
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,910
Key.

287
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,110
24 hours, we'll know

288
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,210
if this new buyer's a cop.

289
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,520
Why didn't you tell Trevor
he might be sending

290
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:05,080
his guy into a setup?

291
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:06,080
Same reason
why I don't tell Gina

292
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:07,320
I'm banging her sister.

293
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:09,990
It'll only cause trouble.

294
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:11,360
What's up?

295
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:13,030
I'm just gonna take off.

296
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:16,030
I don't think you should.

297
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:18,070
Why don't you stay with us
till tomorrow?

298
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,000
Now give me your cell phone.

299
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:21,470
Give me your phone.

300
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:25,800
Don't even think
about warning your boy.

301
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:28,340
'Cause if these guys are cops,
whoever's holding that weed

302
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:30,210
is going to jail
for a long time.

303
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,380
Hey.

304
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:39,350
Hey. God, you scared the hell
out of me.

305
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:40,390
Sorry.

306
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:44,560
Look at you.

307
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:46,160
You look great.
Thanks.

308
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:47,730
Tell me you decided
to work with Trevor.

309
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:50,560
Yeah.
Trial basis. Yeah.

310
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:54,440
What are you doing here?

311
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,140
My mom is coming
by my place later.

312
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:58,270
And I don't want to mess it up,

313
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:00,210
so I'm hanging here.

314
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,240
Got to go.

315
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:04,950
Hey.
Come here.

316
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,320
Mm.

317
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,320
You want to look perfect
on your first day.

318
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:13,190
Yeah.

319
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:19,830
I've got to go.

320
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:22,700
Mm-hmm.

321
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:40,280
Great. Thanks.

322
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:43,320
Donna, we're gonna need
to streamline this.

323
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:45,150
Give each guy a hard time.

324
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:46,720
Before you send them back,

325
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:48,320
give me a wink
if they say something clever.

326
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:50,060
Cool?
Okay.

327
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:51,130
What are you looking for?

328
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,400
Another me.

329
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:19,360
So, chip,

330
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:21,260
what makes you think

331
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,860
that I'm gonna let
the whitest man

332
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:25,060
that I have ever seen
interview for our firm?

333
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:27,960
Because I have an appointment.

334
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:30,600
Hmm.

335
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:56,760
You can do this.

336
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:13,640
Kid, what is wrong with you?

337
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:14,980
You look
like you're 11 years old.

338
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:17,050
I was late to puberty.

339
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:21,950
Harvey Specter.

340
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:48,920
Uh, excuse me.

341
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:51,050
I was thinking
about going for a swim.

342
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,350
Are the pool facilities here
nice?

343
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:53,590
Of course, sir.

344
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:56,690
This is the Chilton Hotel.

345
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,790
And do you have the time?

346
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:03,860
Yes, uh...

347
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:07,030
10:00.
Thanks.

348
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,540
- He saw your gun.
- You think that's him?

349
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:20,250
Matches the description.

350
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:21,980
But he didn't go in the room.

351
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:24,050
It's 10:00 exactly.
He's just walking by?

352
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:29,060
Go after him.
Stay on the radio.

353
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:53,350
Rick Sorkin.

354
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:55,750
Rick Sorkin.

355
00:17:58,690 --> 00:17:59,890
Rick Sorkin?

356
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,160
Excuse me, Mr. Sorkin,

357
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:03,690
you are five minutes late.

358
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,430
Is there a reason
why I should let you in?

359
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,030
Look, I'm just trying
to ditch the cops, okay?

360
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:12,770
I don't really care
if you let me in or not.

361
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:22,310
Mr. Specter will be
right with you.

362
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:24,780
What?

363
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:28,680
Can I get you anything?
A coffee or a bottle of water?

364
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:32,750
Hi, Rick Sorkin.

365
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,720
Harvey Specter.
Nice to meet you.

366
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:37,220
Why don't you have a seat here?

367
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:39,390
Whoa.
What's this?

368
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:47,570
Can I help you?

369
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:50,040
No.

370
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:55,140
How the hell did you know
they were the police?

371
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:57,580
I read this novel
in elementary school,

372
00:18:57,650 --> 00:18:58,980
and it was
the exact same thing.

373
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:01,680
You read a novel
in elementary school.

374
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,950
What?
I like to read.

375
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:06,390
And why'd you ask them
what time it was?

376
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:07,750
Throw 'em off.

377
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:09,120
What kind of drug dealer

378
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:10,790
asks a cop what time it is

379
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:12,590
when he's got a briefcase
full of pot, right?

380
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,930
We should hire you.

381
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,730
Jesus, I'd give you
the 25 grand

382
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,000
as a signing bonus.

383
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:19,430
I'll take it.

384
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,200
Unfortunately,

385
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:22,840
we only hire from Harvard.

386
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:26,170
And you not only did not go
to Harvard law school,

387
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,380
you haven't even gone
to any law school.

388
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,850
What if I told you
that I consume knowledge

389
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:32,110
like no one you've ever met,

390
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:34,050
and I've actually passed
the bar?

391
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:37,450
I'd say you're full of crap.

392
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,160
That's a barbri legal handbook
right there, right?

393
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,790
Open it up.
Read me something.

394
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:44,860
Anything.

395
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:51,200
"Civil liability associated
with agency is based

396
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:53,630
on several factors--"
"Including the deviation

397
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,200
"of the agent from his path,

398
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:57,170
"the reasonable inference
of agency on behalf

399
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,300
"of the plaintiff,
and the nature

400
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:01,110
of the damages themselves."

401
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:03,180
How did you know that?

402
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:07,050
I learned it when I studied
for the bar.

403
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:10,950
Okay, hotshot,

404
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:12,890
fire up this laptop.

405
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,620
I'm gonna show you

406
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:18,130
what a Harvard attorney can do.

407
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:21,330
Pick a topic.

408
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,000
Stock option backdating.

409
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:24,970
Although backdating options
is legal,

410
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,700
violations arise
related to disclosures

411
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:30,840
under IRC section 409A.

412
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:33,010
You forgot
about sarbanes-oxley.

413
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,540
The statute of limitations

414
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:37,150
renders sarbanes-oxley moot
post 2007.

415
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:39,010
Not if you can find actions

416
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,780
to cover up the violation

417
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:44,450
as established in
the sixth circuit, may 2008.

418
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:47,520
That's impressive, but you're
sitting at a computer.

419
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:50,630
Playing hearts.

420
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:53,400
Sorry.
If you want to beat me,

421
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,130
you're gonna have to do it
at something else.

422
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,000
How can you know all that?

423
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:58,530
I told you.
I like to read.

424
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:01,400
And once I read something,
I understand it.

425
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:04,610
And once I understand it,
I never forget it.

426
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:06,240
Why take the bar?

427
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:10,050
This dickhead bet me
I couldn't pass it

428
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:11,250
without going to law school.

429
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:15,920
Okay, look,

430
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:18,120
this is
all pretty fascinating stuff,

431
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:20,290
but I'm afraid
I got to get back to work.

432
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,890
I'll make sure
that serpico isn't around

433
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,890
waiting for you.

434
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:40,280
You want this job so much,

435
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,180
why didn't you just go
to law school?

436
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,580
When I was in college,

437
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:46,150
it was my dream to be a lawyer.

438
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:48,620
I needed some money,

439
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,820
and Trevor convinced me

440
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,890
to memorize this math test

441
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:55,950
and to sell it.

442
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:58,120
Turns out we sold it
to the Dean's daughter.

443
00:21:58,190 --> 00:22:00,630
I lost my scholarship,
I got kicked out of school,

444
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:05,360
I...

445
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:08,840
I got knocked
into a different life.

446
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:12,200
And I have been wishing
for a way back ever since.

447
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:17,780
Let me tell you something.

448
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:20,480
This isn't elementary school.
This is hard work.

449
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:22,480
Long hours.
High pressure.

450
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:24,650
I need a grown goddamn man.

451
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,720
You give me this,

452
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:28,720
and I will work
as hard as it takes

453
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:30,430
to school those Harvard douches

454
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:32,260
and become the best lawyer
you have ever seen.

455
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:34,700
I'm inclined
to give you a shot,

456
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:36,230
but what if I decide
to go another way?

457
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:38,570
I'd say that's fair.

458
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,000
Sometimes I like to hang out
with people

459
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:41,770
who aren't that bright,
you know,

460
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:42,940
just to see
how the other half lives.

461
00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:45,240
Move over.

462
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:48,110
I'm emailing the firm
I just found our next associate.

463
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:55,350
All right.
You're gonna start a week

464
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:56,550
from Monday.

465
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:57,950
Here's what you're gonna do.

466
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:59,850
First, no more pot.
We drug test.

467
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,390
Stop smoking now,
you'll be fine,

468
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:02,920
I assume that's all the drugs
you do.

469
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:04,690
- How do you know that?
- You read books, I read people.

470
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:07,000
And potheads smoke pot.
That's what they do.

471
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:08,870
It's not all I do.
I have interests.

472
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:10,330
You're Albert
friggin' Einstein,

473
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,000
and you couldn't manage
to get into law school?

474
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:13,340
You think that's not
from smoking weed?

475
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,710
- Trevor got--
- That's another thing.

476
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:16,610
You're never gonna talk
to Trevor again.

477
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,210
You're gonna ditch
that briefcase,

478
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:20,040
and you're gonna get on a plane
to Harvard,

479
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:21,680
and you're gonna learn
everything there is

480
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:22,780
about going
to law school there.

481
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:23,810
Did you buy that suit?
Yeah.

482
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,580
Let's buy some new ones.

483
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:35,460
Hi.

484
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:38,030
How do I sign up
for today's law school tour?

485
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:40,230
You go back in time six weeks

486
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,660
because
that's when it booked up.

487
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:43,370
Um...

488
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:45,730
This is Harvard law.

489
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,840
We get over 7,000 applications
a year.

490
00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:51,340
You think you can just walk in
and take a tour?

491
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:53,680
Thank you.

492
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:56,650
Eduardo Fernandez,
who, first of all,

493
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,420
looks like he works
at the public pool or something,

494
00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:01,150
and he comes up to me
the other day,

495
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:02,450
and I completely know
he's a freshman.

496
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,860
And he looks at me and he goes,

497
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,090
"Where's
the public health school?"

498
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,730
Which is right
around the corner,

499
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:08,030
and you know what I tell him?
Clifford Watkins?

500
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:09,700
Excuse me.

501
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,760
Can I help you?

502
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:12,500
Jonathan atwater.

503
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:14,130
I work for Dean wormer
in the admissions office.

504
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,400
Yes, of course.
What can I do for you?

505
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:18,170
Well, the Dean
personally sent me down here

506
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,470
to invite you
to a small cocktail hour

507
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:24,510
for some of
our more realistic candidates.

508
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:26,810
And we'd like to keep
this sort of thing discreet,

509
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,080
so if you'd subtly hand me
your name tag,

510
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:32,380
you can proceed
directly to the Dean's office.

511
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:34,350
Congratulations.

512
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:40,490
Harvard law
is the oldest law school

513
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,160
in the country and boasts

514
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:44,700
the most successful graduates
in the world.

515
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:47,930
Currently, we are six
of nine supreme court justices

516
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,540
and, of course, the president
of the United States.

517
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,350
Uh, hi, good morning.

518
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:43,380
I'm here to see--
Have a seat.

519
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:52,390
Thank you.

520
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:11,140
Mike Ross?

521
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:13,340
Hi, I'm Rachel Zane.

522
00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:15,410
I'll be giving you
your orientation.

523
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:18,550
- Wow. You're pretty.
- Good. You've hit on me.

524
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:20,950
We can get it out of the way
that I am not interested.

525
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:22,090
No, I'm sorry.
I wasn't hitting on you.

526
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:23,150
Trust me.

527
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:24,760
I've given dozens of these,

528
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:26,690
and without fail,
whatever new hotshot it is

529
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,060
thinks that,
because I'm just a paralegal,

530
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:29,830
that I will
somehow be blown away

531
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:31,260
by his dazzling degree.

532
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:33,560
Let me assure you, I won't.

533
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:37,100
I was.
I was hitting on you.

534
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:38,940
You were.
Take notes.

535
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:40,210
I'm not gonna repeat myself.

536
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:43,580
I love you.

537
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:46,610
The firm operates
on a chain of command model.

538
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,220
Harvey's
your commanding officer.

539
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:50,080
However, Louis Litt,
he oversees all associates,

540
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:51,720
so you'll also answer to him.

541
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:53,520
What do you think about Harvey?

542
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:55,290
People are in awe of him.

543
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,020
They say he's the best closer
there is,

544
00:26:57,090 --> 00:26:58,360
but I have very little contact
with him,

545
00:26:58,430 --> 00:26:59,560
so I don't know.

546
00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:01,930
And what about Louis Litt?

547
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:07,070
Let's continue with your tour.

548
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:09,300
Hey, Becky.
You are glowing.

549
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:10,900
I wonder why that is.
Oh, yeah.

550
00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:13,240
It's the day
they announce my promotion.

551
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:14,810
Jimmy, have you lost weight?

552
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,940
Steve-O.

553
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:19,680
Looking like a guy
who came to work.

554
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:21,980
Excuse me,
why are you scratching off

555
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:23,320
the senior off my door?

556
00:27:23,390 --> 00:27:25,320
I got a work order
to take it off.

557
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:27,320
- Who issued the work order?
- My supervisor.

558
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:29,320
Why did he issue
the work order?

559
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:31,330
If I knew that,
I'd be his supervisor.

560
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:33,190
You seem
to be enjoying yourself.

561
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:35,600
I haven't enjoyed myself
since 2004.

562
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:37,430
Donna!

563
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:40,000
Someone's trying to have
a little fun with me here.

564
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:42,700
Jessica wants to see you
in her office.

565
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:44,470
Now.

566
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:50,340
And finally,
this is where you'll live.

567
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:52,180
Wow.

568
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:54,350
I gave you that for a reason.
You haven't taken one note.

569
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:55,580
- That's because--
- Because you were

570
00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:57,220
too busy ogling me to listen

571
00:27:57,290 --> 00:27:58,520
to a word I've said?

572
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:03,020
Partners' offices
anchor the wings.

573
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:05,660
Fifth floor's research,
sixth is security.

574
00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:08,360
All work gets billed,
even if it's finding an address.

575
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:09,730
I answer to Harvey

576
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,400
and Louis Litt,
and, judging by the way

577
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:13,170
you responded to my questions,

578
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,840
I should admire Harvey
and I should fear Louis.

579
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:17,540
You have been here
for five years,

580
00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:18,970
and just because I outrank you

581
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,140
does not mean
I have the authority

582
00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:21,380
to command your services.

583
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:22,810
Oh, it's also pretty clear

584
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,250
that you think you're too smart

585
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:25,380
to be a paralegal.

586
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:27,750
You know what nobody likes?

587
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:29,490
Nobody likes a showoff.

588
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:32,860
You used the word "ogling."

589
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:35,030
When do I get to see Harvey?

590
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:37,330
Gerald Tate fired the firm.

591
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,530
So you're taking
my promotion away.

592
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,400
You know, most firms would put
you in front of the bar

593
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:44,030
and have your license stripped.

594
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:45,840
You lied to a client,
and he figured it out.

595
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:48,240
I lied to him to get him
to do the right thing

596
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:49,810
and honor his goddamn contract.

597
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,080
And you didn't seem
to mind so much

598
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:52,380
when you thought
I got away with it.

599
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,580
But you didn't get away
with it.

600
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:57,020
And I can't justify handing you
a promotion

601
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:58,380
on the same day that you lose
a huge client.

602
00:28:58,450 --> 00:29:01,020
One client doesn't make a firm.

603
00:29:01,090 --> 00:29:02,520
I don't know if you've noticed,

604
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:04,890
but we're in the middle
of an economic meltdown.

605
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,330
Companies
aren't exactly lining up

606
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:08,190
to spend money
on attorneys right now.

607
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:11,300
And, you know, Gerald might
have forgiven the lying

608
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,630
had you not humiliated him.

609
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:16,100
But you did,
and you need to accept that.

610
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:22,170
Jessica, if you hadn't done
as much for me as you have,

611
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,210
I'd be heading for the door.

612
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:26,940
If I hadn't done as much
for you as I have,

613
00:29:27,010 --> 00:29:28,810
I'd be throwing you
out the window.

614
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:32,920
But, Harvey,
no more shenanigans.

615
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:35,820
You do one more thing
that isn't straight as an arrow,

616
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:37,890
and instead
of covering your ass,

617
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,420
I will put you
in front of the bar myself.

618
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:45,130
- Mike.
- Hey.

619
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,700
Who's ready
for a great first day?

620
00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:49,600
I'm gonna have to let you go.

621
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:50,640
- What?
- I just got reamed

622
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,240
for lying to a client,

623
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:53,910
and if they find out
that I lied about you

624
00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:55,240
going to Harvard,
they'll take away my license.

625
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:56,510
You what?

626
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:59,080
Not now, Donna.

627
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:00,650
Look, I have to put
my own interests

628
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:02,150
above yours.
It's nothing personal.

629
00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:04,750
You're fired.

630
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:08,220
Wait, so you're worried
that if I stay,

631
00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:11,560
then they might find out
that you lied about me

632
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:13,960
and you'll lose your license.

633
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:16,230
But if you fire me,
then I could tell them

634
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:17,860
that you lied about me,

635
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:19,430
and you'd definitely lose
your license.

636
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:22,070
Are you telling me that

637
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:23,600
if I throw you under the bus,

638
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:25,040
you're gonna drag me with you?

639
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:27,070
You put your interests
above mine,

640
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:30,640
and I'm just putting mine
back up next to yours.

641
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:33,850
You're rehired.

642
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:38,650
So should I--
all right.

643
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,190
Here's what's gonna happen.
You're gonna give me back

644
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:42,550
my promotion,
and that's the last

645
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:43,720
we're gonna talk about this.

646
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:45,420
And why is that?

647
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:47,260
Because if you don't,
I'm gonna go across town

648
00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:49,090
and join Rick Peterson.

649
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:51,060
I'm gonna approach every client
I've ever closed,

650
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:52,930
and I'm gonna
take them with me.

651
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,730
You do that,
and you'll force me

652
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,300
to put you in front
of the ethics board.

653
00:30:56,370 --> 00:30:58,040
- I don't think you will.
- And why not?

654
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:59,670
Because you were obligated
to notify them

655
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:01,810
the second I lied to Gerald,
but you didn't.

656
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,580
You put me in front
of the board right now,

657
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,910
I'll put you right up there
with me.

658
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:07,480
Hmm.

659
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:15,890
I'll...I'll give you
your promotion.

660
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,660
But you have to do something
for me.

661
00:31:17,730 --> 00:31:18,890
Anything.

662
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,230
Ah.
Pro Bono.

663
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:22,330
Anything but that.

664
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,900
Harvey, Pro Bono cases

665
00:31:23,970 --> 00:31:25,740
are how we, as a firm,
show that we care

666
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,270
about more than just ourselves.

667
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:29,540
I'm not saying
we shouldn't do them.

668
00:31:29,610 --> 00:31:31,040
I'm saying I shouldn't do them.

669
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:32,610
And it's how you can show me

670
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:35,110
that you care about more
than just yourself.

671
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:37,410
You'll handle this yourself.

672
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,780
You will not pass it off.

673
00:31:38,850 --> 00:31:41,380
Absolutely.

674
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:45,790
Your first case.

675
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:46,820
Awesome.
What is it?

676
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:47,830
Pro Bono.

677
00:31:47,890 --> 00:31:49,430
Sexual harassment.

678
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:51,530
Don't tell anyone
I laid it off on you,

679
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,360
and don't screw it up.
Got it.

680
00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:56,400
You can't handle it.
I'll knock it out of the park.

681
00:31:56,470 --> 00:31:58,500
Easy, Clarence Thomas.
Just go meet the client.

682
00:31:58,570 --> 00:32:01,610
Hey. Didn't I tell you
to get some better suits?

683
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,710
I spent $500.

684
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:05,650
For how many suits?

685
00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:07,950
Five.

686
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:09,350
What?

687
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:10,950
Nancy?

688
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:12,620
- Mike?
- Yeah, hi.

689
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:16,920
You're a kid.

690
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:18,990
No, I'm a--
I'm a grown man.

691
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:21,790
You're so skinny.
Have a grape.

692
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:24,500
Thank you.

693
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:26,530
Why don't you tell me
your story?

694
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,230
It started two years ago.

695
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:29,700
I was a stay-at-home mom

696
00:32:29,770 --> 00:32:31,670
to my son, Freddie.

697
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:33,570
And one day
we were at little league,

698
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,210
Freddie was five.

699
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:36,640
He really hated
that he couldn't play

700
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:38,040
with the older kids.

701
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:40,610
It was the third inning,
and I got a phone call.

702
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,950
My husband had been
in a car accident,

703
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:45,010
and he was gone,
just like that.

704
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:47,380
I'm so sorry.

705
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:50,490
I did the best I could.

706
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:52,360
I got myself a job
as a secretary

707
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:53,720
at Devlin McGreggor.

708
00:32:53,790 --> 00:32:54,990
And I even got promoted

709
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:56,260
to secretary of the president,

710
00:32:56,330 --> 00:32:58,360
Charles Hunt.

711
00:32:58,430 --> 00:33:01,500
And that's when it all changed.

712
00:33:01,570 --> 00:33:03,900
It's okay.
Tell me what happened.

713
00:33:03,970 --> 00:33:06,140
He started asking me
to stay late,

714
00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:09,310
order in dinners together,
stuff like that.

715
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:11,680
One night, he says
that if I sleep with him,

716
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:13,110
he's gonna take care of me
in the firm,

717
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:15,710
and, if I don't,
he's gonna fire me.

718
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:16,950
So what did you do?

719
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:18,280
I went to human resources.

720
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:20,250
They said they investigated,

721
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,720
couldn't find anything
to support my claim.

722
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:24,260
Two months later, I was fired

723
00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:26,030
for poor job performance.

724
00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:27,700
They wouldn't let me
say good-bye to anybody.

725
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:30,060
They wouldn't write me
a letter of recommendation.

726
00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:31,730
I wasn't looking for a payoff.

727
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:34,200
All I wanted
was for it to stop.

728
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:36,140
Can you help me?

729
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:39,140
Uh, yes.

730
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:41,540
Yes, I can.

731
00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:43,080
What do you need my help for?

732
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:45,180
- Wait, can I just--
- No, give me the update.

733
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:47,480
You know, she's a nice woman.

734
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:48,920
She--
On the case.

735
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:50,380
I don't get
emotionally attached

736
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:51,780
to the client.

737
00:33:51,850 --> 00:33:53,590
This woman had
her life ripped apart.

738
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:55,190
You don't even care?

739
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:56,890
I'm not about caring.
I'm about winning.

740
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,760
Why can't you be about both?

741
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:00,330
I'd explain it to you,

742
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:03,630
but then I'd have
to care about you.

743
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:05,270
What are you doing?

744
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:06,500
Don't touch that.

745
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:08,270
I'm just checking my lock.

746
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:11,440
You ride your bike to...

747
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:12,470
It's locked, okay?

748
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:14,080
Come on.

749
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:21,050
Defense sent over
the investigation files

750
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,650
as a courtesy.
No, they didn't.

751
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:24,120
Nobody does anything
as a courtesy.

752
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:25,750
They sent those files

753
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:26,960
because that's
where they want you to look.

754
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:28,260
Listen, being a lawyer's

755
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,230
like being a doctor.

756
00:34:30,290 --> 00:34:31,630
You mean how you don't get
emotional about the client?

757
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:33,830
No, I mean you keep pressing
until it hurts.

758
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:35,330
Then you know where to look.

759
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,070
Forget about impeaching
the investigation.

760
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:38,870
It won't lead anywhere.
No employee's gonna testify

761
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:40,370
against their own CEO.
Okay.

762
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:42,240
So what do you suggest I do?

763
00:34:42,310 --> 00:34:44,310
Think.
This guy's done this once...

764
00:34:44,370 --> 00:34:46,110
He's done it before.

765
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:47,540
And if the people
who work for him now

766
00:34:47,610 --> 00:34:49,040
won't testify against him...

767
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:51,650
Someone who used
to work for him might.

768
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:53,150
You know what,

769
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:54,850
I'd subpoena
the personnel records

770
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,380
of every woman
who's left the firm

771
00:34:56,450 --> 00:34:57,950
during this guy's tenure.
That's funny.

772
00:34:58,020 --> 00:34:59,550
That's exactly what I thought.

773
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:01,090
Then what do you need
my help for?

774
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:03,560
I don't know
how to fill out a subpoena.

775
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:08,430
Figure it out yourself.

776
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,630
Donna, can you show me
how to fill out a subpoena?

777
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,200
Absolutely.
And after that,

778
00:35:12,270 --> 00:35:13,740
you want me to show you
how to wipe your ass?

779
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:14,800
It's funny,
because you should already know

780
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:16,170
how to do both those things.

781
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,070
Ha, yeah, that's hilarious.

782
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:20,180
What's that?
That's my suit guy.

783
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,380
Go in, tell him I sent you,
and spend some money.

784
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:24,810
What does it matter
how much money I spend on suits?

785
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,420
People respond
to how we're dressed,

786
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,980
so like it or not,
this is what you have to do.

787
00:35:28,050 --> 00:35:29,990
That's weird,
you giving me advice.

788
00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:32,420
It sounds like you actually care
about me.

789
00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:34,290
I don't.
You're a reflection of me,

790
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,090
and I absolutely care about me.

791
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,430
So get your skinny tie
out of my face and get to work.

792
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:42,730
That was a little harsh.

793
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,300
Really?

794
00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:47,070
Yeah.

795
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:55,240
Mike.

796
00:35:55,310 --> 00:35:57,310
Where are you going?

797
00:35:57,380 --> 00:36:00,010
It's 6:30.
I'm going home.

798
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,850
Okay.
What's so funny?

799
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,480
You're a rookie associate.

800
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:07,020
If you go home before 9:00
on your first week,

801
00:36:07,090 --> 00:36:09,160
you're not gonna make it
through your first month.

802
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:10,620
And Louis Litt
wants to see you.

803
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:12,630
- Hey, can I ask you something?
- Mm-hmm.

804
00:36:12,690 --> 00:36:15,160
This tie, is it too skinny?

805
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:16,400
Yeah.

806
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:19,470
Right.

807
00:36:19,530 --> 00:36:21,430
Yeah.

808
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:31,240
I know you had orientation
from Rachel,

809
00:36:31,310 --> 00:36:35,120
but I wanted to give you
a special welcome from me.

810
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:39,450
Amongst other things,
I'm sort of the disciplinarian

811
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:40,450
of the associates.

812
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:45,760
- You wanted to see me?
- Yes.

813
00:36:45,830 --> 00:36:48,230
Gary, please come in.
Mike, this is Gary Lipsky.

814
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:50,160
Gary's one of our most promising
associates from last year.

815
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:51,930
Hi.

816
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,700
Gary, Ms. Pearson
wanted me to ask,

817
00:36:54,770 --> 00:36:56,240
have you completed
the petramco filing?

818
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:57,940
Well, my brother was in
over the weekend,

819
00:36:58,010 --> 00:36:59,140
so I didn't really get to it.

820
00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:00,910
Look, I mean, Gary, come on.

821
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:02,080
This is, like, the third time
I've had to ask.

822
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:03,540
I'll get right on it.

823
00:37:03,610 --> 00:37:05,310
Don't bother.
You're fired.

824
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:07,250
What?
You can't fire me.

825
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,880
Oh, yes, I can.
And I just did.

826
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:11,580
Go pack up your things.

827
00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:13,820
Don't you ever show your face
in this place again.

828
00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:23,060
See, I arranged
for you to see that

829
00:37:23,130 --> 00:37:25,600
because we pay our associates
very well

830
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:28,440
and we provide the opportunity
for unlimited advancement.

831
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:31,940
But in return
we expect results.

832
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:36,650
Have I made myself clear?

833
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:38,880
Yeah.

834
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,790
Great.

835
00:37:42,850 --> 00:37:44,890
Welcome to Pearson Hardman.

836
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:53,260
Feel free to go back to work.

837
00:37:55,870 --> 00:37:57,900
Harvey.

838
00:37:57,970 --> 00:38:01,040
Okay, I have two words for you.

839
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:03,740
Absolutely beautiful.

840
00:38:03,810 --> 00:38:06,240
You think you're the only one
who can charm a client?

841
00:38:06,310 --> 00:38:09,080
Categorically stunning.

842
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:11,110
How's the new kid working out?

843
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:13,280
Regally hot.

844
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:15,980
- You're an idiot.
- Jessica Pearson.

845
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:18,050
Good night, Harvey.

846
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:27,060
What are you doing here?

847
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:29,570
Watching <i>sportscenter.</i>

848
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:32,230
Boo-yah.

849
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:33,640
You won't return
my phone calls.

850
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:35,800
Ah, yeah,
because you set me up.

851
00:38:35,870 --> 00:38:38,040
Do you remember that?
You think I knew about that?

852
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:40,810
Here we go.
Round 50 of I get the shaft

853
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:43,010
because you didn't know
the whole story.

854
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,810
You knew there were risks
when you quoted that crap

855
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,080
from that book.

856
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:47,720
Okay, you needed money,

857
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:49,120
and I came through
with an opportunity

858
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:50,990
like always.

859
00:38:51,050 --> 00:38:52,050
Besides, you weren't
the only one who got screwed.

860
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:53,460
They pulled a gun on me.

861
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,560
Oh, really?

862
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:55,930
And why did they do that?

863
00:38:55,990 --> 00:38:57,190
To keep me from warning you.

864
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:58,860
So you did know.

865
00:38:58,930 --> 00:39:00,360
Well, not until
after it was too late.

866
00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:01,960
Well, it's too late now.

867
00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:03,800
Look, let me make it up to you.

868
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:05,470
Oh, you want
to make it up to me?

869
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:08,370
Give me my key back.

870
00:39:15,210 --> 00:39:17,950
Michael.

871
00:39:18,010 --> 00:39:20,050
Come on.

872
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:21,280
You know I don't want
to live in a world

873
00:39:21,350 --> 00:39:23,490
where we're not tight.

874
00:39:24,650 --> 00:39:27,290
Then kill yourself.

875
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,890
Get out.

876
00:39:30,530 --> 00:39:33,530
Get the hell out.

877
00:39:57,810 --> 00:39:59,290
Donna, I need the--

878
00:39:59,390 --> 00:40:01,090
oh, also I didn't have
a chance to--

879
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:02,720
marry me?
- I took care of that too.

880
00:40:02,790 --> 00:40:04,390
We've been married
for the last seven years.

881
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:06,490
Excellent.

882
00:40:06,850 --> 00:40:09,570
Umm, Devlin McGreggor's
fighting the subpoena.

883
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,390
They filed a motion
to dismiss the case

884
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:12,720
based on our lack of evidence.

885
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:13,700
- Good.
- Good.

886
00:40:13,770 --> 00:40:15,270
Wait, what do you mean, "good"?

887
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:16,700
They don't want
to hand over the files.

888
00:40:16,770 --> 00:40:18,170
You pressed where it hurt.

889
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,710
You're looking
in the right place.

890
00:40:19,770 --> 00:40:20,940
Did you think
they wouldn't fight back?

891
00:40:21,010 --> 00:40:22,670
Well, I--
now that you mention it.

892
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:24,140
Oh, my bad.

893
00:40:24,210 --> 00:40:25,510
I keep forgetting

894
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:26,910
you don't
actually know anything.

895
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:28,610
- The idea is,

896
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,420
you make a move,
they make a move.

897
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,080
You go back and forth
until one of you wins.

898
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:33,690
Okay, what if they win
the motion

899
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:35,550
and the case gets dismissed?

900
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:37,920
You're not as good
as you think you are.

901
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:41,060
Harvey.
What a coincidence.

902
00:40:41,130 --> 00:40:42,730
I was wondering
how the Pro Bono was coming.

903
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:43,800
I'm all over it.

904
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:45,100
That makes me very happy,

905
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:46,730
because if I were to find out

906
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:47,970
that you weren't putting in
your full effort,

907
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:49,230
I'd be very upset.

908
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:51,640
No worries.
We're all good.

909
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:02,380
Rachel! Rachel, Rachel,
Rachel. I need your help.

910
00:41:02,450 --> 00:41:03,750
There's a hearing
on my subpoena.

911
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:05,320
I've got three cases
in front of you,

912
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:06,320
so you're gonna have
to wait in line.

913
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:07,390
No. No, no, no.

914
00:41:07,450 --> 00:41:08,990
My hearing is tomorrow.

915
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:10,320
So why are you coming to me?

916
00:41:10,390 --> 00:41:13,120
Because Donna says

917
00:41:13,190 --> 00:41:14,530
you're the best researcher
in the firm.

918
00:41:14,590 --> 00:41:17,500
Let me see the motion.

919
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:19,870
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

920
00:41:19,930 --> 00:41:21,670
You have an office?

921
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:24,400
How do you have an office
and I have a cubicle?

922
00:41:24,470 --> 00:41:26,600
Like you said,
I'm the best researcher

923
00:41:26,670 --> 00:41:28,440
in the firm.
Really?

924
00:41:28,510 --> 00:41:30,010
I just made that up.

925
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:32,480
I didn't even have time
to talk to Donna.

926
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:35,550
Is this all a joke to you?

927
00:41:35,610 --> 00:41:36,750
'Cause I take my job seriously.

928
00:41:36,810 --> 00:41:38,220
No, I'm sorry.

929
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:40,650
Look, I was--

930
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:43,120
look, you weren't there, okay.

931
00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:45,490
I care about this woman.

932
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:47,630
She's got
nowhere else to turn--

933
00:41:47,690 --> 00:41:49,130
- and you can't help her
by yourself.

934
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,430
I can.

935
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:54,330
I just prefer not to.

936
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:57,840
Okay.

937
00:41:57,910 --> 00:41:59,240
You're asking to look
at private files

938
00:41:59,310 --> 00:42:00,670
without any evidence
of your assertion.

939
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:01,840
Yeah, but the only way
that we can find

940
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:03,640
the evidence is to look
at those files.

941
00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:04,640
It's a rickety argument.

942
00:42:04,710 --> 00:42:06,810
But is there a precedent?

943
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:10,620
Let's go see
if we can find one.

944
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:13,190
Research is as much art
as science,

945
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:15,890
so we're gonna look
at privacy and harassment law

946
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:18,260
so you can find a combination
of cases

947
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:20,060
to make an argument.
I'll take privacy.

948
00:42:20,130 --> 00:42:21,690
I'll take harassment law.

949
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,260
This'll take a while.

950
00:42:23,330 --> 00:42:24,930
We're gonna need dinner.

951
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,070
- Chinese.
- No.

952
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:28,500
I can afford Chinese on my own.

953
00:42:28,570 --> 00:42:30,300
This is on the firm.
I want sushi.

954
00:42:30,370 --> 00:42:32,010
Ooh.

955
00:42:32,070 --> 00:42:34,210
So they told me to put
my top investigator on it.

956
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:36,510
- What did you do?
- What could I do?

957
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:38,280
You were out of the country,
I gave them Luderman.

958
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:41,520
By the way, that dress...

959
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:42,850
What, this old thing?
Come on.

960
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:44,950
Beautiful.

961
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:46,760
Vanessa, why don't we do this
more often?

962
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:49,760
'Cause it always ends
the same way.

963
00:42:49,830 --> 00:42:51,960
Then why are we doing it now?

964
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:54,430
Harvey, I don't sleep around.

965
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:56,860
And I could never be
in a relationship with you.

966
00:42:56,930 --> 00:42:59,100
All you ever think about
is yourself.

967
00:42:59,170 --> 00:43:01,740
I'm thinking about you and me
right now.

968
00:43:05,870 --> 00:43:07,410
Please.
I insist.

969
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:08,610
But I'm a gentleman.

970
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:10,780
Besides, you came through

971
00:43:10,850 --> 00:43:12,680
on Dockery for me,
and I'm not one

972
00:43:12,750 --> 00:43:14,580
to forget a favor.

973
00:43:14,650 --> 00:43:16,590
Neither am I.

974
00:43:22,730 --> 00:43:25,400
Mr. Dockery,
you naughty, naughty boy.

975
00:43:30,430 --> 00:43:33,640
You remember when I said
you thought you were too smart

976
00:43:33,710 --> 00:43:34,940
to be a paralegal?
Mm-hmm.

977
00:43:35,010 --> 00:43:37,040
- Why...
- Aren't I a lawyer?

978
00:43:37,110 --> 00:43:39,110
Mm.

979
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:41,710
I don't test well.
What?

980
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:43,810
I am smart.

981
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:45,450
And I know
I'd be a good lawyer.

982
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:46,880
I just--I don't know
what it is.

983
00:43:46,950 --> 00:43:47,850
I can't take tests,

984
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:50,890
and I bombed the lsats.

985
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:52,320
And even if I could get

986
00:43:52,390 --> 00:43:53,520
into law school, there's no way

987
00:43:53,590 --> 00:43:55,460
I'd pass the bar.

988
00:43:55,530 --> 00:44:00,060
So if only there was someone
who could take the test for me.

989
00:44:00,130 --> 00:44:02,430
- Yeah, if only there were.
- Yeah.

990
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:05,300
Hi. Where are you at
with the research

991
00:44:05,370 --> 00:44:07,710
for tomorrow's hearing?
Nothing yet.

992
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:08,710
You say you care
about the client,

993
00:44:08,770 --> 00:44:10,140
but if you keep playing footsie

994
00:44:10,210 --> 00:44:11,740
instead of finding me
an argument,

995
00:44:11,810 --> 00:44:13,440
the client's gonna lose.

996
00:44:13,510 --> 00:44:15,010
I don't want to lose.

997
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:17,250
Ugh.

998
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:20,720
Look, it's no use.

999
00:44:20,790 --> 00:44:23,120
Okay, their investigation's
by the book.

1000
00:44:23,190 --> 00:44:24,460
We look like the bad guys
coming in,

1001
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:25,860
putting them under duress.

1002
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:27,660
What did you just say?

1003
00:44:27,730 --> 00:44:29,030
I said we look
like the bad guys.

1004
00:44:29,090 --> 00:44:30,930
No, you said

1005
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,500
they did it by the book

1006
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:34,200
and we're putting them
under duress.

1007
00:44:34,270 --> 00:44:38,940
Yeah.

1008
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:41,610
- Look.
- Hmm.

1009
00:44:41,670 --> 00:44:43,510
This is good.
We're gonna have some fun.

1010
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:46,450
We?
I get to go?

1011
00:44:46,510 --> 00:44:47,910
You didn't think
I'd let you come along?

1012
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:49,980
- No.
- Good instinct. I wasn't.

1013
00:44:50,050 --> 00:44:51,520
But then I thought
it'd be cruel

1014
00:44:51,590 --> 00:44:53,250
not to let you witness
my greatness.

1015
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:55,560
- Okay, can I go get my bag?
- No.

1016
00:44:55,620 --> 00:44:57,430
- You're a true giver.
- Other side.

1017
00:44:57,490 --> 00:45:00,530
Okay.

1018
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:02,600
Your honor, this case
should be thrown out.

1019
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:04,430
Other than her story,
the plaintiff doesn't have

1020
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:06,370
one piece of evidence.

1021
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:08,500
Because the evidence lies
within their personnel files,

1022
00:45:08,570 --> 00:45:11,140
which they're conveniently
refusing to hand over.

1023
00:45:11,210 --> 00:45:13,010
Those files contain
sensitive information.

1024
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:14,640
He's fishing at the expense

1025
00:45:14,710 --> 00:45:16,250
of our employees' right
to privacy.

1026
00:45:16,310 --> 00:45:18,610
Please.
They don't give a rat's ass

1027
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:20,550
about his employees' right
to privacy.

1028
00:45:20,620 --> 00:45:23,590
Sorry, that's actually unfair
to rats' asses.

1029
00:45:23,650 --> 00:45:25,590
Your honor, Mr. Specter's
claim that we don't care

1030
00:45:25,660 --> 00:45:27,690
about our employees,
though belittling,

1031
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:30,190
doesn't carry any weight
as a rule of law.

1032
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:32,600
True, but what does carry
weight is that an investigation

1033
00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:34,330
of sexual harassment
must be conducted

1034
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:35,630
without any duress.

1035
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:36,930
Your point?

1036
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,930
The investigator
and every person

1037
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
being interviewed
answers to the ceo

1038
00:45:41,070 --> 00:45:42,400
they're investigating.

1039
00:45:42,470 --> 00:45:47,210
That is the definition
of duress.

1040
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:48,510
It'd be as if your bailiff

1041
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:50,910
accused you of sexual harassment

1042
00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:52,450
and you assigned
your stenographer

1043
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:54,720
to investigate.

1044
00:45:54,790 --> 00:45:56,190
Now how likely would it be

1045
00:45:56,250 --> 00:45:58,290
that this investigation
yielded any fruit?

1046
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:01,390
You honestly think
I would harass Herman?

1047
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:02,830
Well, I don't know, your honor.

1048
00:46:02,890 --> 00:46:04,590
Some people have a thing
for the uniform.

1049
00:46:04,660 --> 00:46:07,660
Ugh. I'd like to think
Herman would come to me

1050
00:46:07,730 --> 00:46:09,930
before it even got
to an investigation.

1051
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:14,500
I saw that.
That should be stricken.

1052
00:46:14,570 --> 00:46:16,870
But what if Herman did come
to you, your honor?

1053
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:18,780
And you betrayed his trust

1054
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:20,980
by firing him
under false pretenses?

1055
00:46:21,050 --> 00:46:22,810
You really think
that little of me?

1056
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:26,220
I wouldn't trust you
as far as I could throw you.

1057
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:28,390
Your honor.

1058
00:46:28,450 --> 00:46:30,920
Hand over the files...

1059
00:46:30,990 --> 00:46:32,390
- Oh--
- Today.

1060
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:34,290
That's it.

1061
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:38,760
Herman, I'd like to speak
to you in chambers.

1062
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:41,530
That was awesome.

1063
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:42,600
It was your argument.

1064
00:46:42,670 --> 00:46:44,100
I just framed it in a way

1065
00:46:44,170 --> 00:46:45,570
that humanized the situation

1066
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:47,110
and brightened
all of our afternoons.

1067
00:46:47,170 --> 00:46:48,740
I feel like Michael corleone
in that scene

1068
00:46:48,810 --> 00:46:50,810
where that fat guy teaches him
how to shoot that gun.

1069
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:51,910
Are you saying
that I'm the fat guy?

1070
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:53,350
'Cause I'm not the fat guy.

1071
00:46:53,410 --> 00:46:55,950
Mm.

1072
00:46:56,020 --> 00:46:57,620
You know what his name was?

1073
00:46:57,690 --> 00:46:59,190
- Yeah.
- Cordoza.

1074
00:46:59,260 --> 00:47:00,620
- Clemenza.
- I knew that.

1075
00:47:00,690 --> 00:47:01,990
I was just testing
to see if you knew it.

1076
00:47:02,060 --> 00:47:04,590
I knew that you knew
that I knew.

1077
00:47:11,770 --> 00:47:18,040
♪ ♪

1078
00:47:18,110 --> 00:47:21,310
Train wreck.

1079
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:22,640
Hey, I'm looking

1080
00:47:22,710 --> 00:47:23,980
for rene.

1081
00:47:24,050 --> 00:47:25,810
I'm rene.
I'm sorry.

1082
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:29,520
We don't sell skinny jeans
at this location.

1083
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:32,850
Did Harvey tell you
I was coming, or...?

1084
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:34,750
Harvey Specter sent you?

1085
00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:36,820
That's another story.

1086
00:47:36,890 --> 00:47:38,360
Do you know your inseam?

1087
00:47:38,430 --> 00:47:40,990
I don't.
It's probably a medium.

1088
00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:44,000
Oh. Why don't you browse
for a while?

1089
00:47:44,070 --> 00:47:45,130
These are the most exclusive,

1090
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:46,230
and we move down in price

1091
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:50,040
as you head to the door.

1092
00:47:50,110 --> 00:47:53,110
Oh.
Okay.

1093
00:47:56,650 --> 00:47:58,780
Large?

1094
00:47:58,850 --> 00:48:02,480
That's not how it works.

1095
00:48:02,550 --> 00:48:04,890
Huh.

1096
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:18,100
So Trevor's getting you to do
his dirty work for him, huh?

1097
00:48:18,170 --> 00:48:20,800
All I know is you
aren't talking to each other.

1098
00:48:20,870 --> 00:48:21,800
I miss you.

1099
00:48:21,870 --> 00:48:23,140
I want things

1100
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:24,570
to go back
to the way they were.

1101
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:26,970
I miss you too.
But...

1102
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:28,640
I'm not sure
things are ever going back

1103
00:48:28,710 --> 00:48:29,840
to the way they were.

1104
00:48:29,910 --> 00:48:32,480
I gotta go.

1105
00:48:32,550 --> 00:48:34,050
What did he say?

1106
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:35,550
He said things
aren't ever going back

1107
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:38,220
to the way they were.

1108
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:40,020
What did you do?

1109
00:48:40,090 --> 00:48:41,790
I don't know.

1110
00:48:47,390 --> 00:48:48,890
Hey.

1111
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:50,800
So the files are on their way.

1112
00:48:50,860 --> 00:48:52,160
We won?

1113
00:48:52,230 --> 00:48:53,160
That's fantastic.

1114
00:48:53,230 --> 00:48:54,530
So now we have a week

1115
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:56,800
to corroborate Nancy's story.

1116
00:48:56,870 --> 00:49:01,140
Listen, I couldn't have done it
without you.

1117
00:49:01,210 --> 00:49:03,840
You wouldn't even know
where to look without me.

1118
00:49:03,910 --> 00:49:04,980
You know what nobody likes?

1119
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:07,210
Nobody likes a showoff.

1120
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:10,920
Hello.

1121
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:12,080
Yeah, he's here.

1122
00:49:12,150 --> 00:49:14,920
Okay. Thank you.

1123
00:49:14,990 --> 00:49:16,850
Files are in conference room C.

1124
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:19,660
Why wouldn't they bring them
to my cubicle?

1125
00:49:19,730 --> 00:49:22,730
They're trying to bury you
in paperwork.

1126
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:25,600
Well, they picked
the wrong guy.

1127
00:49:25,660 --> 00:49:27,330
If they didn't, I did.

1128
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:28,770
Get it done
by the end of the week.

1129
00:49:28,830 --> 00:49:29,970
I got to run
and charm our new client.

1130
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:37,480
Nice to finally meet you.

1131
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:41,550
Jessica says you're
gonna sweep me off my feet.

1132
00:49:41,610 --> 00:49:43,680
I'll do my best,
Mr. Dockery.

1133
00:49:43,750 --> 00:49:44,880
You got a nice serve there.

1134
00:49:44,950 --> 00:49:47,420
Working on it.

1135
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:51,520
What the hell is this?

1136
00:49:51,590 --> 00:49:52,420
It's you having sex
with a woman

1137
00:49:52,490 --> 00:49:54,360
who isn't Mrs. Dockery.

1138
00:49:54,430 --> 00:49:55,930
Are you trying to blackmail me?

1139
00:49:55,990 --> 00:49:57,560
You asked my firm
where you're vulnerable

1140
00:49:57,630 --> 00:49:58,730
to corporate takeover.

1141
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:00,400
That's it right there.

1142
00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:01,460
What are you pulling here?

1143
00:50:01,530 --> 00:50:02,970
Your wife owns 10%

1144
00:50:03,030 --> 00:50:04,900
of the company's voting shares.

1145
00:50:04,970 --> 00:50:06,540
You've been seeing this woman
and several others

1146
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:08,040
for quite some time.

1147
00:50:08,110 --> 00:50:09,670
How do you think
your wife's gonna vote

1148
00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:12,140
after she finds out?
Who says she has to find out?

1149
00:50:12,210 --> 00:50:14,750
My investigator got these
within a week.

1150
00:50:14,810 --> 00:50:17,350
What do you think
a motivated competitor's

1151
00:50:17,420 --> 00:50:19,180
gonna dig up in a year?

1152
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:23,850
I have a solution.

1153
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:25,760
Trade her your preferred shares,

1154
00:50:25,820 --> 00:50:27,120
which have no voting rights,

1155
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:29,160
for her common shares,
which do.

1156
00:50:29,230 --> 00:50:31,560
The preferred shares
are worth $2 million more.

1157
00:50:31,630 --> 00:50:32,900
A fraction of what you'll lose

1158
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:34,600
if you get voted
out of your company.

1159
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:36,030
John, I don't care if you sleep

1160
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:37,530
with every woman
in the Hamptons.

1161
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:39,730
Just give her
the preferred shares.

1162
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:45,070
Jessica said you were gonna
charm me to get my business.

1163
00:50:45,140 --> 00:50:46,840
I'm not interested
in getting your business.

1164
00:50:46,910 --> 00:50:49,410
I'm interested in keeping it.

1165
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:51,550
I know where
they don't want us to look.

1166
00:50:51,610 --> 00:50:54,080
Did you get through
all those files in one night?

1167
00:50:54,150 --> 00:50:55,480
I would have done it faster,

1168
00:50:55,550 --> 00:50:57,250
but I ordered a pizza.

1169
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:59,320
Speaking of which,
have you ever had

1170
00:50:59,390 --> 00:51:00,920
the cheese in the crust?

1171
00:51:00,990 --> 00:51:03,860
Because it blew my mind.
What'd you find?

1172
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:06,860
There was a dismissal
on march 12th, 2005.

1173
00:51:06,930 --> 00:51:09,160
But the file with the employee
name on it is missing.

1174
00:51:09,230 --> 00:51:10,760
It's our woman.
I know it is.

1175
00:51:10,830 --> 00:51:12,760
I'm moving to slap sanctions

1176
00:51:12,830 --> 00:51:14,530
on their attorney,
possible jail time.

1177
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:16,300
Guy's not gonna know
what hit him.

1178
00:51:16,370 --> 00:51:20,070
Dennis, it's Harvey Specter.

1179
00:51:20,140 --> 00:51:23,940
Did you have anything to do
with the march 12, 2005 files

1180
00:51:24,010 --> 00:51:26,110
left out of discovery?

1181
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:28,450
If they're here by noon,
I'll believe you.

1182
00:51:28,510 --> 00:51:31,650
If not,
we're filing for sanctions.

1183
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:34,050
Threat of sanctions is better
than filing for sanctions.

1184
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:36,890
That's what I meant.
Threaten, not file.

1185
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:37,960
Who would mean that?

1186
00:51:38,030 --> 00:51:40,260
Shave.

1187
00:51:40,330 --> 00:51:42,330
Have you ever heard
of this woman?

1188
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:43,660
Joanna Webster?

1189
00:51:43,730 --> 00:51:45,360
No. Why?

1190
00:51:45,430 --> 00:51:46,830
The company's trying
to hide her from us.

1191
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:48,570
You think Hunt did
the same thing to her

1192
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:50,170
that he did to me?
Yes.

1193
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:52,940
Then you have to make her
come forward and say so.

1194
00:51:53,010 --> 00:51:54,370
Yeah.
That's the plan.

1195
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:56,940
Thank you.

1196
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:07,590
Joanna Webster?

1197
00:52:07,650 --> 00:52:08,920
Can I help you?

1198
00:52:08,990 --> 00:52:11,290
Hi.
My name's Mike Ross.

1199
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:12,520
I'm a--
I'm a lawyer.

1200
00:52:12,590 --> 00:52:14,160
I have some questions for you

1201
00:52:14,230 --> 00:52:17,300
about your time
at Devlin McGreggor.

1202
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:19,300
Please. Look, just let me
tell you a story

1203
00:52:19,370 --> 00:52:20,400
about my client, okay?

1204
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:23,840
Fine. Just a second.

1205
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:25,340
Mr. Ross,

1206
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:27,840
what happened to me
happened six years ago.

1207
00:52:27,910 --> 00:52:29,470
It was horrible,

1208
00:52:29,540 --> 00:52:30,880
and there was a reason
I didn't do anything

1209
00:52:30,940 --> 00:52:32,010
about it.

1210
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:33,550
They'll put me on that stand

1211
00:52:33,610 --> 00:52:35,750
and attack me,
and I don't want that.

1212
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:39,750
Ms. Webster, Joanna,

1213
00:52:39,820 --> 00:52:42,320
this man is a predator,

1214
00:52:42,390 --> 00:52:45,460
and if you don't help stop him,
he will do it again.

1215
00:52:48,590 --> 00:52:50,130
All you have to do
is give a deposition.

1216
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:51,860
I'm sorry.

1217
00:52:51,930 --> 00:52:55,600
I can't do it.

1218
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:06,410
What happened with the witness?

1219
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:10,720
Uh, I failed...

1220
00:53:10,780 --> 00:53:13,920
To not be awesome.

1221
00:53:13,990 --> 00:53:16,350
I got her to testify!

1222
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:19,490
You should have seen me.
I tried everything.

1223
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:21,260
He'd do it again,

1224
00:53:21,330 --> 00:53:22,530
I'd be with her every step
of the way...

1225
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:23,600
Nothing worked.

1226
00:53:23,660 --> 00:53:26,330
And then it hit me.

1227
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:29,600
I asked her
what if it was her daughter

1228
00:53:29,670 --> 00:53:31,240
that he did this to.

1229
00:53:31,310 --> 00:53:34,270
She melted.

1230
00:53:34,340 --> 00:53:36,340
And you know how I came up
with that little gem?

1231
00:53:36,410 --> 00:53:40,520
I cared about her.
Oh.

1232
00:53:40,580 --> 00:53:43,280
Yeah.

1233
00:53:43,350 --> 00:53:45,220
Thank you.

1234
00:53:45,290 --> 00:53:46,720
I'm glad to see
that staying up all night

1235
00:53:46,790 --> 00:53:47,820
doesn't make you act
like a complete idiot.

1236
00:53:47,890 --> 00:53:49,520
Go home and get some sleep.

1237
00:53:49,590 --> 00:53:50,860
I don't want you waving
that thing around

1238
00:53:50,930 --> 00:53:52,130
during tomorrow's deposition.

1239
00:53:57,830 --> 00:53:59,500
Harvey.

1240
00:53:59,570 --> 00:54:01,900
How's the pro Bono going?

1241
00:54:01,970 --> 00:54:05,640
Great. I just talked a witness
into testifying.

1242
00:54:05,710 --> 00:54:08,740
Really?
What's the witness's name?

1243
00:54:10,710 --> 00:54:11,780
I'm not an idiot.

1244
00:54:11,850 --> 00:54:13,310
Don't treat me like one.

1245
00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:15,120
You pawned off the case.

1246
00:54:15,180 --> 00:54:17,790
Jessica,
I've got higher profile cases--

1247
00:54:17,850 --> 00:54:19,990
Need I remind you
that when we first met,

1248
00:54:20,060 --> 00:54:21,760
you were a screw-up?

1249
00:54:21,820 --> 00:54:23,590
I gave you a shot
at the mail room,

1250
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:26,030
led you up the ranks, and then
paid for you to go to Harvard,

1251
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:29,070
where, by the way,
you jerked off the entire time

1252
00:54:29,130 --> 00:54:32,140
you were there,
and I still hired you.

1253
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:34,210
And you've benefited
from that ever since.

1254
00:54:34,270 --> 00:54:36,140
Look, I closed the Dockery case,
okay.

1255
00:54:36,210 --> 00:54:38,080
You made a promise to me.

1256
00:54:38,140 --> 00:54:41,680
You broke it, and then you lied
to my face.

1257
00:54:41,750 --> 00:54:44,750
So let me be clear.
This isn't professional.

1258
00:54:44,820 --> 00:54:46,380
This is personal.

1259
00:54:46,450 --> 00:54:48,120
And I'll tell you
something else.

1260
00:54:48,190 --> 00:54:52,160
You made your bed,
you better goddamn win.

1261
00:55:06,140 --> 00:55:09,170
God damn it.

1262
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:22,050
What the hell is wrong with you?
I need the briefcase back.

1263
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:23,590
Oh, so that's what this
has been about, huh?

1264
00:55:23,660 --> 00:55:25,660
You don't care
about our friendship at all.

1265
00:55:25,730 --> 00:55:27,290
You're my oldest friend,
and you know it.

1266
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:29,530
But you don't seem
to care about that anymore,

1267
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:31,130
and, yeah, I need
the briefcase back.

1268
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:32,860
And I'm gonna find it, Mike.

1269
00:55:32,930 --> 00:55:34,370
Well, I ditched it
when I was running away

1270
00:55:34,430 --> 00:55:37,340
from the cops
that you sent me into.

1271
00:56:00,060 --> 00:56:02,360
Mike.

1272
00:56:02,430 --> 00:56:04,030
Where you going?

1273
00:56:04,100 --> 00:56:06,470
To my cubicle.

1274
00:56:06,540 --> 00:56:09,500
No, you're not.
It's pee in a cup time.

1275
00:56:09,570 --> 00:56:12,010
I'm sorry. What?

1276
00:56:12,070 --> 00:56:14,440
Drug test.
Follow me.

1277
00:56:16,180 --> 00:56:17,550
I'm just gonna put my stuff
back--

1278
00:56:17,610 --> 00:56:19,480
now.

1279
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:30,630
Oh, by the way, my cousin
was your year at Harvard.

1280
00:56:30,700 --> 00:56:32,860
And I asked him if he knew you.

1281
00:56:32,930 --> 00:56:35,300
It's so funny.
He didn't.

1282
00:56:35,370 --> 00:56:36,630
Well, what's his name?

1283
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:37,930
Mitch samberg.

1284
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,670
Yeah.
Don't know him.

1285
00:56:41,210 --> 00:56:42,310
It's a big school.

1286
00:56:42,370 --> 00:56:44,370
Not really.

1287
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:47,140
We get 7,000 applications
a year.

1288
00:56:47,210 --> 00:56:49,450
You think you can just walk in
and take a tour?

1289
00:56:49,510 --> 00:56:51,450
Oh, Mitchell.

1290
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:52,950
With the slicked back hair,

1291
00:56:53,020 --> 00:56:54,450
graduated seventh in the class.

1292
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:56,550
Sure. Yeah.
I remember him.

1293
00:56:56,620 --> 00:56:58,860
Time to face the music.

1294
00:57:04,830 --> 00:57:07,200
I got to get
to the Kendrick filing.

1295
00:57:07,260 --> 00:57:08,360
Where the hell is Mike?

1296
00:57:08,430 --> 00:57:12,130
I don't know.

1297
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:14,140
Leave the cup on the counter.

1298
00:57:18,140 --> 00:57:20,010
You'll have to leave that
out here.

1299
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:22,450
- Why?
- If you take it in there

1300
00:57:22,510 --> 00:57:23,750
with you, I have to check
to make sure you don't have

1301
00:57:23,820 --> 00:57:24,950
another urine sample in it.

1302
00:58:08,330 --> 00:58:11,430
- Where you been?
- Hi. Um...

1303
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:12,960
Getting drug tested, actually.

1304
00:58:13,030 --> 00:58:15,630
The deposition's
this afternoon.

1305
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:17,500
Before they get here, I want you
to grill this woman

1306
00:58:17,570 --> 00:58:18,970
about her background
for anything they might use

1307
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:20,170
against her.

1308
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:21,940
You got it?
Got it.

1309
00:58:22,010 --> 00:58:23,470
- Make her tell you everything.
- Everything.

1310
00:58:23,540 --> 00:58:24,570
- Everything.
- Everything.

1311
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:27,440
- Okay.
- Okay.

1312
00:58:35,250 --> 00:58:38,250
I had been working six months

1313
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:41,090
when Mr. Hunt started asking me
to work more,

1314
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:42,960
order dinner.

1315
00:58:43,030 --> 00:58:47,670
One night, late, he tried
to have sex with me.

1316
00:58:47,730 --> 00:58:51,640
The next day, I requested
a change in assignment.

1317
00:58:51,700 --> 00:58:55,340
Two months later I was fired
for having a bad attitude.

1318
00:58:55,410 --> 00:58:57,940
This is ridiculous.

1319
00:58:58,010 --> 00:58:59,610
Wipe that smirk off your face.

1320
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:01,110
You're not even supposed
to be here.

1321
00:59:01,180 --> 00:59:03,780
Mr. Hunt has every right
to be here.

1322
00:59:03,850 --> 00:59:08,050
Now, Ms. Webster, after working
for Devlin McGreggor,

1323
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:10,720
you then went on to waitress
at Hooters, right?

1324
00:59:10,790 --> 00:59:13,720
- Yes, I did.
- A place that advertises

1325
00:59:13,790 --> 00:59:16,160
the sexuality
of its waitstaff, correct?

1326
00:59:16,230 --> 00:59:18,430
You will have to ask them that.

1327
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:20,360
I'm asking you.

1328
00:59:20,430 --> 00:59:24,530
And she's not answering.
Move on.

1329
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:29,870
Ms. Webster, would you say
that you're a truthful person?

1330
00:59:29,940 --> 00:59:32,480
Yes.

1331
00:59:32,540 --> 00:59:35,150
So when you said earlier
that you had never been arrested

1332
00:59:35,210 --> 00:59:38,320
for a crime, you were speaking
the truth?

1333
00:59:38,380 --> 00:59:41,690
- Yes.
- Yes, so in 1993 then

1334
00:59:41,750 --> 00:59:45,520
you were not arrested for
stealing $1,000 worth of jewelry

1335
00:59:45,590 --> 00:59:48,830
from the willow grove mall
in Pennsylvania?

1336
00:59:48,890 --> 00:59:53,230
I was 17.
That was one mistake.

1337
00:59:53,300 --> 00:59:55,330
Those records were supposed
to be sealed.

1338
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:57,300
So when you say
those records were sealed,

1339
00:59:57,370 --> 00:59:58,770
what you mean to say
is you thought

1340
00:59:58,840 --> 00:59:59,800
you could get away with a lie?

1341
00:59:59,870 --> 01:00:01,510
No, that's not it.

1342
01:00:01,570 --> 01:00:03,510
You're making it seem
different that it is.

1343
01:00:03,570 --> 01:00:06,280
I'm sorry.
You were arrested in your past

1344
01:00:06,340 --> 01:00:08,010
and you lied about it here
under oath.

1345
01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:10,110
Is that
making it seem different

1346
01:00:10,180 --> 01:00:12,020
than what it is?

1347
01:00:14,390 --> 01:00:17,960
No answer.
Hmm, all right.

1348
01:00:18,020 --> 01:00:20,590
Let me ask you this,
since you've lied here once,

1349
01:00:20,660 --> 01:00:23,330
what's to make us believe
you're not lying about Mr. Hunt?

1350
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:38,240
How the hell did you miss
that arrest?

1351
01:00:38,310 --> 01:00:40,380
I did every background check
we have.

1352
01:00:40,450 --> 01:00:41,550
Did you grill her
like I told you to?

1353
01:00:41,610 --> 01:00:43,180
It was a sealed record, Harvey!

1354
01:00:43,250 --> 01:00:44,180
Goddamn it, I knew it.

1355
01:00:44,250 --> 01:00:45,980
Fix it.

1356
01:00:46,050 --> 01:00:48,920
Joanna!
Wait. Please!

1357
01:00:48,990 --> 01:00:50,660
This is why I didn't want
to testify.

1358
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:52,190
They twist something
from 100 years ago

1359
01:00:52,260 --> 01:00:54,460
and make me look like a liar.

1360
01:00:54,530 --> 01:00:55,630
They make it sound
like what he did

1361
01:00:55,690 --> 01:00:57,230
to me didn't happen.

1362
01:00:57,300 --> 01:00:58,760
It doesn't matter.
All right?

1363
01:00:58,830 --> 01:01:00,160
I just--I need you
to testify on Friday

1364
01:01:00,230 --> 01:01:02,000
and keep this case alive.

1365
01:01:02,070 --> 01:01:03,700
We don't have time to find
anyone else before--

1366
01:01:03,770 --> 01:01:04,970
would you please wait?

1367
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:06,770
No. I'm not waiting.

1368
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:08,240
You promised this
wouldn't happen, and it did.

1369
01:01:08,310 --> 01:01:10,740
You never told me
you were arrested.

1370
01:01:10,810 --> 01:01:13,480
Don't contact me again, please.

1371
01:01:51,310 --> 01:01:54,010
What happened with the witness?

1372
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:57,950
Nothing. Nothing happened.
I couldn't fix it.

1373
01:01:58,020 --> 01:02:00,920
So you're going to quit?

1374
01:02:00,990 --> 01:02:03,320
It's either that
or have Louis Litt fire me.

1375
01:02:03,390 --> 01:02:04,860
What are you talking about?

1376
01:02:04,930 --> 01:02:07,100
My first day,
Louis fired Gary Lipsky

1377
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:08,760
for screwing up a case.

1378
01:02:08,830 --> 01:02:10,400
He said if I did the same thing

1379
01:02:10,470 --> 01:02:12,500
I'd be gone just as fast.

1380
01:02:12,570 --> 01:02:13,870
Well, you go back
to the witness' house

1381
01:02:13,940 --> 01:02:15,640
and you get her
to testify again.

1382
01:02:15,710 --> 01:02:17,570
- I tried. There's no way.
- There's always a way.

1383
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:19,070
Then why don't you go
and convince her?

1384
01:02:19,140 --> 01:02:20,810
Because you screwed it up.

1385
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:22,910
Oh, and you don't give
a damn about the client. Right.

1386
01:02:22,980 --> 01:02:24,720
- That's not my job.
- Does your job

1387
01:02:24,780 --> 01:02:26,120
include giving a damn about me?

1388
01:02:26,180 --> 01:02:27,720
Because the least
you could do is offer

1389
01:02:27,790 --> 01:02:29,390
to stand up to Louis for me.
Stand up for you?

1390
01:02:29,450 --> 01:02:30,760
I put my ass
on the line for you,

1391
01:02:30,820 --> 01:02:32,260
but it turns out
you may have had the balls

1392
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:34,230
to get this job,
but you don't have the courage

1393
01:02:34,290 --> 01:02:35,930
to stick it out
when it gets tough.

1394
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,360
- That's not true.
- Isn't it?

1395
01:02:37,430 --> 01:02:39,060
You've had one foot
out the door

1396
01:02:39,130 --> 01:02:40,900
since you got here.
What are you talking about?

1397
01:02:40,970 --> 01:02:42,230
I'm talking
about that briefcase

1398
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:43,940
being locked in your desk.
Yeah, I saw it.

1399
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,900
And I know what it is.

1400
01:02:45,970 --> 01:02:48,240
It's your backup plan
in case this doesn't work out.

1401
01:02:48,310 --> 01:02:50,070
You can make some quick cash
and go right back

1402
01:02:50,140 --> 01:02:52,380
to the life you told me
you didn't want to lead.

1403
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:55,110
So if you want to quit,
go ahead.

1404
01:02:55,180 --> 01:02:58,080
But this isn't because of Louis,
and it isn't because of me.

1405
01:02:58,150 --> 01:02:59,680
It's because you're afraid
you might have to admit

1406
01:02:59,750 --> 01:03:01,920
that you're not
as smart as you think you are.

1407
01:03:04,990 --> 01:03:06,460
If you're here in the morning,

1408
01:03:06,530 --> 01:03:08,260
I'll know
I still have an associate.

1409
01:04:00,610 --> 01:04:03,350
Hey, I get that you were upset

1410
01:04:03,420 --> 01:04:04,980
that I was promoted before you,

1411
01:04:05,050 --> 01:04:07,350
but if you ever threaten to fire
one of my guys again,

1412
01:04:07,420 --> 01:04:09,790
I am going to kick your ass.

1413
01:04:09,860 --> 01:04:13,230
Hmm.
What are you talking about?

1414
01:04:13,290 --> 01:04:15,090
Don't play dumb with me,
all right?

1415
01:04:15,160 --> 01:04:19,200
You fired Gary Lipsky
in front of Mike Ross.

1416
01:04:19,270 --> 01:04:21,900
What's so funny?

1417
01:04:21,970 --> 01:04:24,270
Gary Lipsky works
in the mail room.

1418
01:04:24,340 --> 01:04:28,440
- What?
- I didn't fire anyone.

1419
01:04:28,510 --> 01:04:29,640
That's how I let
the new associates know

1420
01:04:29,710 --> 01:04:31,540
what's expected of them.

1421
01:04:31,610 --> 01:04:35,450
You plant a fake employee
to manipulate the assoc--

1422
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:36,680
that's it.

1423
01:04:36,750 --> 01:04:38,880
What?

1424
01:05:03,510 --> 01:05:06,180
Michael.

1425
01:05:06,250 --> 01:05:09,750
I want to quit.

1426
01:05:09,820 --> 01:05:13,020
Come here.

1427
01:05:22,030 --> 01:05:24,300
When your parents died,

1428
01:05:24,370 --> 01:05:28,900
I lost
my son and my daughter-in-law.

1429
01:05:28,970 --> 01:05:34,840
I was scared, alone,
and I was too old to raise you.

1430
01:05:34,910 --> 01:05:36,750
But I had no choice.

1431
01:05:36,810 --> 01:05:42,550
Because who else was going
to care of my grandson?

1432
01:05:42,620 --> 01:05:46,320
You made me a promise before.

1433
01:05:46,390 --> 01:05:49,760
You're in the door.

1434
01:05:49,830 --> 01:05:52,530
Promise me now the only way
you'll leave

1435
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:55,900
is if they rip you out.

1436
01:06:07,980 --> 01:06:09,520
You can save your breath.

1437
01:06:09,580 --> 01:06:10,680
There's no way I'm testifying

1438
01:06:10,750 --> 01:06:12,420
at the hearing tomorrow.

1439
01:06:12,490 --> 01:06:14,990
That's not why I'm here.

1440
01:06:15,050 --> 01:06:17,320
I know what you did.
What are you talking about?

1441
01:06:17,390 --> 01:06:19,490
You never worked
for Devlin McGreggor,

1442
01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:21,630
and you were never harassed
by Mr. Hunt.

1443
01:06:21,690 --> 01:06:23,590
- That's a l--
- Now I could tell you

1444
01:06:23,660 --> 01:06:25,900
that I've got the canceled
checks or the wire transfer

1445
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:28,770
or whatever smoking gun
that exists--I don't.

1446
01:06:28,830 --> 01:06:30,270
But I will.
And when I do,

1447
01:06:30,330 --> 01:06:31,830
you'll be going to jail
unless you tell me

1448
01:06:31,900 --> 01:06:34,270
what happened right now.

1449
01:06:35,970 --> 01:06:38,110
I'm the guy you tell.

1450
01:06:41,180 --> 01:06:44,110
All I had to do was waste
your time until tomorrow

1451
01:06:44,180 --> 01:06:45,980
after the hearing.

1452
01:06:46,050 --> 01:06:50,020
Please,
I just needed the money.

1453
01:06:50,090 --> 01:06:52,320
I don't want to go to jail.

1454
01:06:52,390 --> 01:06:56,090
Here's what you're gonna do...

1455
01:06:56,160 --> 01:06:59,030
Did you call this place before?

1456
01:06:59,100 --> 01:07:00,800
Mike!

1457
01:07:00,870 --> 01:07:01,900
- Hey.
- I'm not giving this to you

1458
01:07:01,970 --> 01:07:03,670
because you need it.

1459
01:07:03,740 --> 01:07:06,740
I'm giving it to you
because I don't.

1460
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:09,240
And I don't know if I'm ready
to forgive you yet or not,

1461
01:07:09,310 --> 01:07:11,910
but I do know we're even.

1462
01:07:11,980 --> 01:07:15,710
Wait a second.

1463
01:07:18,950 --> 01:07:20,920
I...

1464
01:07:20,990 --> 01:07:22,790
Well...

1465
01:07:29,130 --> 01:07:31,130
Don't.

1466
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:32,160
Now we're even.

1467
01:07:36,170 --> 01:07:37,170
Huh.

1468
01:07:49,720 --> 01:07:54,050
I see you came to work today.
Nice suit.

1469
01:07:54,120 --> 01:07:56,690
It was a barter transaction.

1470
01:07:56,760 --> 01:07:59,720
I got six of them
for one little briefcase.

1471
01:08:02,760 --> 01:08:06,430
Listen...

1472
01:08:06,500 --> 01:08:08,430
I'm sorry and--

1473
01:08:08,500 --> 01:08:11,100
Forget it.

1474
01:08:11,170 --> 01:08:14,940
When I first started,
Jessica rode me so hard...

1475
01:08:15,010 --> 01:08:16,940
I quit once a month.

1476
01:08:17,010 --> 01:08:19,940
I just told you
what you needed to hear.

1477
01:08:20,010 --> 01:08:22,950
That's just it.
I've only ever had one person

1478
01:08:23,010 --> 01:08:26,720
who told me
what I needed to hear.

1479
01:08:26,780 --> 01:08:29,850
Maybe it's time I started
trusting somebody else.

1480
01:08:39,630 --> 01:08:41,400
Merry Christmas.

1481
01:08:46,270 --> 01:08:47,330
Is this for real?

1482
01:08:47,400 --> 01:08:50,040
You know what to do.

1483
01:08:51,240 --> 01:08:53,840
Press until it hurts.

1484
01:08:53,910 --> 01:08:58,510
Wire transfer from your
account to Joanna Webster's,

1485
01:08:58,580 --> 01:09:00,950
phone records
with Joanna Webster

1486
01:09:01,010 --> 01:09:03,320
prior to her testimony,

1487
01:09:03,380 --> 01:09:05,920
and an affidavit stating
you paid Ms. Webster

1488
01:09:05,990 --> 01:09:07,820
to falsely testify.

1489
01:09:09,860 --> 01:09:12,530
Mr. Hunt, harassment
is a civil violation.

1490
01:09:12,590 --> 01:09:13,930
The penalty is money.

1491
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
But witness tampering,
that's a crime,

1492
01:09:16,060 --> 01:09:17,500
and you will go to prison,

1493
01:09:17,570 --> 01:09:18,830
where I guarantee you'll learn

1494
01:09:18,900 --> 01:09:20,670
more about unwanted
sexual advances

1495
01:09:20,740 --> 01:09:22,540
than you can possibly imagine.

1496
01:09:22,610 --> 01:09:26,010
Do you think
this is going to intimidate me?

1497
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:28,140
Even if this evidence
was credible,

1498
01:09:28,210 --> 01:09:29,580
who are you going to get
to prosecute

1499
01:09:29,650 --> 01:09:31,510
a small-time
witness tampering charge, huh?

1500
01:09:31,580 --> 01:09:35,050
Harvey, didn't you graduate
law school

1501
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:37,220
with the current
U.S. attorney in New York?

1502
01:09:37,290 --> 01:09:38,950
In fact, I did.

1503
01:09:39,020 --> 01:09:40,520
And I think
he might even be interested

1504
01:09:40,590 --> 01:09:41,890
in pursuing a case like this.

1505
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:43,360
Wait, are you two still close?

1506
01:09:43,430 --> 01:09:44,990
Well, I was the best man
at his wedding.

1507
01:09:45,060 --> 01:09:46,530
- Wow.
- No, you weren't.

1508
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:47,860
You're bluffing.

1509
01:09:47,930 --> 01:09:49,300
No.

1510
01:09:49,360 --> 01:09:50,770
I think I've got
some pictures...

1511
01:09:50,830 --> 01:09:53,600
Of us at the ceremony.

1512
01:09:53,670 --> 01:09:55,570
Let's see.

1513
01:09:55,640 --> 01:09:58,000
Yeah.
Here we are.

1514
01:09:58,070 --> 01:10:01,040
You must admit,
I look very dashing.

1515
01:10:01,110 --> 01:10:02,310
This is me and his mother.

1516
01:10:02,380 --> 01:10:03,780
The woman adores me.

1517
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:05,380
Here we are
at his bachelor party.

1518
01:10:05,450 --> 01:10:07,850
There's no strippers.
It was lame.

1519
01:10:07,910 --> 01:10:10,350
But he can't put guys like you
away for sexual harassment

1520
01:10:10,420 --> 01:10:12,250
and then go to strip clubs,
now, can he?

1521
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:13,850
All right.
What do you want?

1522
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:16,390
An admission of guilt
and a guarantee

1523
01:10:16,460 --> 01:10:19,030
that you'll obtain treatment
before working again.

1524
01:10:21,100 --> 01:10:23,530
And Nancy gets reinstated
with back pay.

1525
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:26,370
- Fine.
- And a raise.

1526
01:10:26,430 --> 01:10:28,440
Okay.
All right.

1527
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:30,170
Are we done?

1528
01:10:30,240 --> 01:10:31,870
The kid should be able
to grow up without the burden

1529
01:10:31,940 --> 01:10:33,670
of tuition hanging over
his head, don't you think?

1530
01:10:33,740 --> 01:10:34,840
Which is why
you're also gonna pay Nancy

1531
01:10:34,910 --> 01:10:36,180
an extra $250,000.

1532
01:10:36,250 --> 01:10:37,650
Charles.

1533
01:10:41,750 --> 01:10:44,050
Gentlemen.

1534
01:11:02,440 --> 01:11:06,010
Thank you for everything.

1535
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:07,610
You're welcome.

1536
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:09,110
So just one question.

1537
01:11:09,180 --> 01:11:10,280
Why'd you go to Joanna's house?

1538
01:11:10,350 --> 01:11:12,110
Because I figured it out.

1539
01:11:12,180 --> 01:11:13,580
I object.

1540
01:11:13,650 --> 01:11:15,320
I think you did it
because you care.

1541
01:11:15,380 --> 01:11:17,590
I did it because it's my job.

1542
01:11:17,650 --> 01:11:19,660
Would you admit it?
You care about me.

1543
01:11:19,720 --> 01:11:22,020
I saw you smile when I showed up
for work this morning.

1544
01:11:22,090 --> 01:11:25,960
I didn't smile.
I was thinking of a funny joke.

1545
01:11:26,030 --> 01:11:27,800
Look,
we start on this tomorrow.

1546
01:11:27,860 --> 01:11:30,170
Does this mean
we're officially a team now?

1547
01:11:30,230 --> 01:11:32,270
I wouldn't move your things
into Wayne manor just yet.

1548
01:11:32,340 --> 01:11:36,170
- So now you're Batman?
- Closer to him than Clemenza.

1549
01:11:36,240 --> 01:11:39,310
- Oh, yeah, kilmer.
- Clooney.

1550
01:11:39,380 --> 01:11:41,040
Keaton.

1551
01:11:41,110 --> 01:11:44,080
Did you really quit
when you first started?

1552
01:11:44,150 --> 01:11:45,649
Of course not.
I'm not a wuss.

1553
